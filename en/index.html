                <h2>Living far from home</h2>

                <p>Living abroad is a complex experience, who would understand? Being physically distant from what is familiar, missing important moments with loved ones, adapting to a new culture, communicating in another language, creating a new support network — it's crossing both a literal and symbolic ocean of emotions.</p>

                <p>Anxiety, loneliness, helplessness, among many other difficulties can be part of this process. Psychotherapy offers a human, safe, and ethical space to embrace these experiences, understand their impacts, and create strategies to deal with them in a more balanced way, promoting well-being.</p>

                    <h3>About me</h3>

                    <p>Graduated in Psychology from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in 2017, with emphasis on Neuroscience and Behavior Analysis, I discovered in college a passion that would take me far beyond borders.</p>
                    
                    <p>At 20, I completed my first academic exchange, studying for two semesters at the University of Porto in Portugal. After graduation, I spent several years between clinical care and organizational psychology until a professional opportunity took me to Berlin, Germany, where I worked at a large multinational for two years. Currently, I am pursuing a double degree master's program, partly in Spain and partly in Italy, which has allowed me to deepen my knowledge in social psychology, as well as rekindling my interest in clinical practice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>About the approach</h3>

                    <p>Online therapy with a human and integrative approach, combining principles of Behavior Analysis, Social Psychology, and Neuroscience. I use evidence-based techniques to understand behavioral patterns, helping to promote effective and lasting changes. Each intervention is carefully adapted to your needs, taking into account the complexity of the emotional and cultural experiences you're going through.</p>
                    
                    <p>All treatment is conducted with respect for professional ethics and absolute confidentiality, creating a safe and welcoming space where you can explore and understand your challenges with confidence and clarity.</p>
